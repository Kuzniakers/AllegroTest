# Allegro Test Plan and Test Cases

This repository contains test plan and test cases for the Allegro.pl e-commerce platform. The goal of this project is to ensure the high quality and functionality of the platform, as well as to identify and resolve any potential issues that could impact user experience.

## Polish Language

I have created the test plan and test cases in the Polish language, as I was working for a Polish company. This allowed me to better understand and address the specific needs and expectations of my client and their user base.

## Contents

- `plan_testow.md`: Contains the test plan for Allegro.pl, detailing the objectives, scope, resources, approach, schedule, and more.
- `przypadki_testowe.md`: Contains the test cases for various aspects of the platform, such as functional testing, compatibility testing, performance testing, usability testing, security testing, and exploratory testing.

## TestRail Usage

I have utilized TestRail, a popular test case management tool, to create and manage my test cases. 

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, simply clone this repository or download the `.md` files to your local machine. You can then open the files in any Markdown editor or text editor to view and edit the test plan and test cases.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you would like to suggest improvements or additions to the test plans and test cases, please feel free to create a pull request or open an issue in this repository.

## Future Development

In the future, I plan to continue creating and updating test cases according to the test plan, using specialized testing tools. This will ensure that the quality and functionality of Allegro.pl continue to meet the high standards expected by our users. Stay tuned for updates and improvements to the test plan and test cases in this repository.
